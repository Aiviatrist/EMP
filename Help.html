       <h4>In the world, depression is not uncommon, affecting as many as 1 in 7 people in their lifetime. Chances are, you will know several people with either diagnosed or undiagnosed depression. By understanding and talking about this, we can help friends, family, colleagues and others in our society who experience depression. It is important to know that talking about depression does not make the situation worse. In fact, conversations that help to bring awareness and support for depression, are a positive thing. Individually, we can support someone who is experiencing depression by learning to recognise the signs, showing empathy, reducing stigma and offering support.</h4>

       <h4>Depression is a diagnosable illness where a person experiences sadness, lack of pleasure, irritation or negative thinking most of the time. It can seriously affect a personâ€™s mental and physical wellbeing. Depending on its severity, it can also impact a personâ€™s participation in relationships, work, education and the social aspects of life. For some, it can be a debilitating, long-term struggle. Others may overcome depression over a shorter timeframe, with the right supports.
Depression can affect people from all walks of life. There are several different factors that can impact the causes and severity of depression. These include life events, lifestyle, physical health, genetics, and personality. Just like any other illness, depression is not the fault of the person experiencing it. As with someone experiencing a physical illness, they deserve compassion, respect and access to support.</h4>
